# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies patterns and predicts which customers are likely to leave the service.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Churn_Modelling.csv`, which includes features related to customer demographics, financial behavior, and service engagement.

### Features

- **CreditScore**: Customer's credit score.
- **Geography**: Customer's geographic location.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the company.
- **Balance**: Customer's account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer's estimated annual salary.
- **Exited**: Target variable indicating if the customer has exited (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- **src/**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved models and results.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**: Train the models using the training script.
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models and view the results.
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

## Results

- **KNN**: Accuracy - 83%, ROC-AUC - 0.90
- **Naive Bayes**: Accuracy - 76%, ROC-AUC - 0.84
- **SVM**: Accuracy - 88%, ROC-AUC - 0.95
- **Decision Tree**: Accuracy - 82%, ROC-AUC - 0.82

## Conclusion

The SVM model performed the best, with the highest accuracy and ROC-AUC score. Further improvements can be made through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
